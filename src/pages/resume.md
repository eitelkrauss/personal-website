## Experience

### _Frontend Engineer_ @ [Eclipsoft][eclipsoft]
2022 - Present

#### Projects:

- #### [Onboarding][onboarding]

  A hybrid (SSG/SSR/SPA) app built with Nuxt.js.  It's a template for companies to implement an onboarding process with their own branding system.
  We integrated [ID4Face][id4face] to handle face recognition and liveness validation.  
  Forms are rendered dynamically from a JSON provided by an API and can be edited on the admin site like a CMS.
  

- #### [ID4Face][id4face]

  We used [Lit.dev][lit-dev] to build a web component (in this case a modal) for liveness validation and face recognition using an ML model (facemesh).
  The user can provide a base64 image for reference or use an integrated service that queries the end user's data from the national registry office in Ecuador and uses the image stored in their database for the comparison.
  You can try it by uploading a picture to use as reference image.

- #### Branded CSS design system

  Worked closely with the design team to implement stylesheets to be shared across all company products to keep a consistent branding style
