            <h2>Custom Onboarding Solution with Nuxt</h2>
            A custom onboarding solution developed with Nuxt 3. This project
            features various views, workflows, forms, styles, fonts, and
            content, all manageable through a CMS-style admin site. Notably,
            Nuxt 3 employs hybrid rendering, pre-rendering the landing page
            during build time and seamlessly transitioning to a client-side SPA
            for efficient user navigation.<a
